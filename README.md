# JQuery-Powered Work Scheduler

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a flexable and slightly customizable appointment saver. It allows the user to enter and save notes or appointment reminders with color coded time slots indicating past, current, and future entries. The purpose of this project was to dive in and get comfortable using JQuery coupled with Bootstrap.

## Installation

## Usage

The scheduler will load time slots from 9am to 5pm unless changed in JavaScript. If there are previously saved notes then they will be loaded into their appropriate time slots. The user can click into any time slot text area and type in their notes. Once the user clicks the blue save button the input is saved to localstorage. The time slots will also highlight grey if that hour has passed, red if its the current hour, and green if the hour is later.
